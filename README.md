This repository contains notes for various classes and seminars that I teach at NYU. They are focused on teaching programming for data science to non-CS majors. The emphasis is on offering live examples that students can use directly to complete their goals. 

## Accesing your Data Science Environment 

* [Accesing your Data Science Environment](https://github.com/ipeirotis/docker/blob/master/README.md)

We setup and deploy our data science environment (effectively, Jupyter with Python and R support, plus MySQL) using docker. As our default option, we allow students to connect to a JupyterHub server that runs on Kubernetes. We also give the option to students to run the same environment locally on their laptops, or deploy the Docker image on AWS or Google Cloud.

* First class, describe syllabus, setup EC2, sync notebooks. Then skip CURL/UNIX, and run a few print commands. Then proceed to expressions and try to run a few exercises with just expressions. 

* The second session (numeric variables) has sufficient exercises for variables to last the whole session. For the job-offer example, we can give an example where yearly_offer is updated line by line, as this is a conceptually new step, instead of writing y = s + b*s + e/v, you can write y = s, then y = y + b*s, .... Then introduce the += notation as well.


* Rename class to "Introduction to Programming for Data Science". 

* Add while loops before discussing for loops. Allows easier discussion of break/continue compared to for. (Perhaps even before complex data structures, as it is connected with if-else?)

* More exercises in loops
